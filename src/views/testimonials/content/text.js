			"I have known Jennifer for more than 30 years.  I knew her first through athletics, competing with her at a college level, seeing her willingness to work hard and sacrifice. I worked with her when she was a nurse at St. John’s level one trauma, emergency room and was amazed at her ability to to work under pressure and yet be sincere, caring and kind to all manner of people in some of the most difficult situations.",
			"The most impactful circumstances that leads to my unwavering belief in Jennifer, was witnessing her complete commitment to her recovery.  She has worked tirelessly to heal herself and through her understanding of all aspects of her recovery she has learned how to work as a guide and educator for others. This is an ongoing process for Jennifer, demonstrating her relentless pursuit to comprehend all processes surrounding addiction recovery; its effects, manifestations, and ways to cope and heal.  I have watched her give at least two speeches her knowledge base combined with her humanity, intelligence, honesty, and humor make her a remarkable speaker; I learned, I cried, I was impacted just as the others in the audience were impacted.  Jennifer is “real” her passion is compelling as only a survivor and one who thrives can be.",
			"I consider Jennifer’s journey a testimony to the importance of one person’s courage and vulnerability to heal as she has the heart and credibility to shine a light for others."
